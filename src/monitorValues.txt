// When your heart BPM is at "highHeartRate" Sonic will run at speed "highSonicSpeed"

// If your BPM is outside these bounds, the computer will extrapolate linearly, like a straight line graph

// this is what Sonic's top running speed will be, as a HEX number
// 0600 is Sonic's normal top running speed
// 1800 seems like a suitably absurd top speed

// this is how fast Sonic will accelerate, as a HEX number
// Sonic's speed will never clip above or below these values
// 000C is Sonic's normal accelleration
// 0080 is nice and at absurd speeds
